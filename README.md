☕ Coffee Sales Performance Dashboard

Project Overview

This project involved the design and implementation of a dynamic, interactive dashboard to monitor and analyze historical coffee sales performance across key geographical markets. The primary goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence for product strategy, pricing optimization, and regional sales management.

The dashboard utilizes data covering Order Date, Coffee Type, Roast Type, Product Size, Sales, and Country to track performance over a multi-year period (2019-2022).

Key Features & Analysis

The dashboard is structured to provide both high-level summaries and granular detail through interactive filtering:

1. Sales Trend Analysis

Time-Series Visualization: Tracks monthly sales volume over time, segmented by all four coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Libara, Robusta). This allowed for the identification of seasonal demand shifts and long-term performance trends for specific blends.

2. Profitability and Customer Insights

Customer Segmentation: Ranks and visualizes sales contribution by individual customers, identifying the top performers.

Loyalty Impact: Allows filtering sales data based on whether customers possess a 'Loyalty Card,' providing insight into the value of the loyalty program.

3. Geographical Performance

Regional Comparison: Displays total sales distribution across the main operating countries (United Kingdom, Ireland, United States), clearly highlighting the market with the strongest sales presence.

4. Interactive Filtering

Dynamic Slicers: Implemented slicers for Roast Type (Dark, Light, Medium), Loyalty Card (Yes/No), and Size (0.2 kg, 0.5 kg, 1.0 kg, 2.5 kg), enabling users to perform custom, on-the-fly analysis of specific product permutations.

Tools and Technologies

Data Processing & Visualization: Microsoft Excel (or appropriate tool like Power BI/Tableau - Adjust this based on the tool you actually used)

Data Analysis: Formulas, Pivot Tables, and Data Aggregation techniques.

Data Source: Structured transactional sales data (CSV/Excel format).

Results & Impact

Identified key drivers and operational bottlenecks affecting sales volume and revenue.

Provided visualizations that underpinned recommendations for leadership on optimizing product strategy and pricing.

Engineered a solution that supports data-driven decision-making, simulating internal business review reporting.
